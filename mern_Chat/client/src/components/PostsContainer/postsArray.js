Instead, get eager to start one of the healthiest, most environmentally friendly, and most satisfying forms of self-transportation possible. It requires preparation, technique, and a little falling, but anyone can learn how to ride a bicycle. Safety first! Practice on flat, smooth ground in daylight. Wear a helmet and elbow and knee pads to protect yourself in case you fall.",
